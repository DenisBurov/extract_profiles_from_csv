# extract_profiles_from_csv
This MATLAB code extracts the field profiles from .CSV files obtained via XFDTD EM-modelling software package.
There are 4 files with fields in .CSV format for reference. 
To run the code, make sure all the files are in the same directory and adjust the path to your .CSV files on line 6 in field_profiles.m
Then simply execute the code.
Data preprocessing stage may be modified according to your specific needs (different slices, different coordinates, inconsistencies in .CSV export files, etc.)
